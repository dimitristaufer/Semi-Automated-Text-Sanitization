This classic comedy drama play about manners , classes , and the problems that arise can be both funny and tragic often at the same times has a first rate cast featuring Blair Brown as Lady Teazy , an unsatisfied married wife , whose husband deplores her youthful behavior . They travel to England and meet and socialize with the British gentry . Mind you that this play was written before or during the American Revolution . There is still that British type of humor and fun with an American cast such as Blair Brown and Larry Gates in roles . The costumes and art direction are first rate and the story and dialogue may be dated but it's worth watching . It's like being at the theater without all the troubles of being there .

Almost unrecognizable , she received negative , malevolent treatment from total strangers . People were not giving her the time of the day . Obesity is seen as a weakness or an embarrassment by the general population . Even though , the American population is getting more obese each day and not just by eating the wrong foods . One of the reasons I love this movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Rosemary gives her a heart and soul . You cannot help but like Rosemary . When Hal sees her under Tony Robbins spell , you begin to see a pattern . He sees other people in the same light . Their inner beauty comes alive . The most heart-wrenching scene is at the pediatric burn unit where he is comforting Cadence . It is perhaps my favorite scene in the movie . Hal becomes more human and falls in love with Rosemary even though he does not see the actual person until the end of the film . I cannot help but like this film for not trying to change Rosemary nor anybody else . It was Hal who needed to be changed . Love is blind until you see the inner beauty of your soulmate . This film is also good to watch to gain a better tolerance and understanding of obesity . You do not have to be physically beautiful to have inner beauty . Inner beauty remains long after the physical beauty has faded away .
",Gwyneth Paltow's portrayal of RosemARY is one of the most heartbreaking and moving parts of this film. She is constantly being discriminated against by people who don't even recognize her.

Now Will is gay so forget about it . But I think it provides the wrong impression that straight heterosexual women need the company of gay men for platonic friendship . Heterosexual women are very competitive and vicious about going after men and they probably feel comfortable with gay men as friends but it's still sending the wrong message of heartbreak and the lack of realism . I also find Megan Mullally's character as Karen annoying and Sean Hayes ' Jack equally annoying . These four characters are the most shallow , vain , characters on television . Why would anybody straight or gay want them ? Over the last 8 years , this show has been considered a breakthrough but I think it sets women back . I liked Debra Messing better on Ned and Stacey . DOn't get me wrong about gays and straights having friendship .

I love the memoriam segment but I didn't think they should put the clip of Shelley Winters winning an Emmy . They should have shown a clip from the Roseanne show .

I just wished the SPelling family would patch up their differences and reunite as well . They shot a lot of Candy Spelling and Tori who sat on the other side of the auditorium . Candy was in tears next to Randy . Anyway , I loved the Dick Clark tribute and realize that he is no longer the teenage idol and Barry Manilow's tribute to him . I thought it was ironic that Simon Cowell introduced him . Poor Dick , I hope he is recognized and inducted into the Kennedy Center Honors this year and the National Medal of the Arts as well .

0,"A Worthy but disappointing effort on the Civil War I applaud their efforts about America's darkest hour which was the American Civil War from 1860 to 1865 . The drama is that it was brother and brother , north against south . America lost more men on it's own battlefields in this war than any foreign wars combined . While Europe remembers two World Wars , America must remember the Civil War . It's sad and depressing to know that most Americans know less about the Civil War than foreign wars . Anyway , the film's battle scenes are shot exquisitely . The brutality and force of the war must be seen to know the evil and horrors of any war . The Civil War is a tough chapter in American history . Unfortunately , this film is almost four hours long and there is so many situations and characters about that you can easily get lost in it . I watched it on video at home . My boss who is a big Civil War buff drove almost 2 hours to see this film and liked it . While some of us are not geared to watching war movies , if you like Gettysburg , you will like Gods and Generals . The actors , Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall who lives in Virginia himself perform brilliantly and almost unrecognizably . I also liked Frankie Faison in the film as a Black soldier . If this film was released on television as a mini-series , I have no doubt that there would have been awards . The scenery , costumes , and art direction have spared no expense . I believe it was a mistake to release it in theaters because I don't think audiences can sit through 4 hours of this film . Ted Turner , the media mogul , did a service to producing this film . Maybe students in American classrooms will learn to appreciate the magnitude of the Civil War . I'm giving it an 8 .

It may not be the best movie but it is fun to watch and enjoy . Tim Conway is unbelievable as a burned out postman . Laurie Metcalf as a burned out lawyer . Greg Kinnear who joins this zany group of people who are ordinary and do something to make themselves extraordinary people . It gives you a warm feeling by the end of the movie . Please rent or buy this movie . It's fun for the whole family . I love watching Rue McClanahan and Jack Klugman . The story might be flawed but it's always worth watching especially around the holidays when you need a little cheering up to do . Greg Kinnear is a good actor who is working at being a good film actor .

The show never ignored away from serious subjects such as teenage pregnancy , homosexuality , poverty , drugs , abortion , alcoholism , etc . It was the kind of show that teens should be shown to show that they are not alone in the world nor are they alone in getting trouble . I have to say that the first season with Arthur and Stephanie was worth watching .
