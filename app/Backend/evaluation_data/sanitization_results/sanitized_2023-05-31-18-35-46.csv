0,"George Washington's Favorite Play ! Okay , the Broadway Theater Archives were to American public television that Masterpiece Theater is and was to television . This classic comedy drama play about manners , classes , and the problems that arise can be both funny and tragic often at the same times has a first rate cast featuring Blair Brown as Lady Teazy , an unsatisfied married wife , whose husband deplores her youthful behavior . They travel to England and meet and socialize with the British gentry . Mind you that this play was written before or during the American Revolution . There is still that British type of humor and fun with an American cast such as Blair Brown and Larry Gates in roles . The costumes and art direction are first rate and the story and dialogue may be dated but it's worth watching . It's like being at the theater without all the troubles of being there .

0,"An okay movie of the week ! Linda Lavin gives an exceptional heartwarming performance in a typical television Holocaust film of the week . Her Lena is portrayed admirably by Ms . Lavin . The children were well-acted and performed also admirably . Since reading the book , I have gained a little knowledge more as to the conditions to postwar Poland . The film itself should be seen and book should be read to gain further understanding about the Holocaust . There is nothing really special about this film except Lavin can do more than play television's Alice . I hope this book and movie can inspire teachers to help students understand the subject a lot better than some other movies or books .

Anyway it's a small role but he does a very good job in making us like this drunk homeless guy who lives across the street from the practice . Anyway , Sean hasn't recovered from his loss . He is devastated when his daughter Annie can't come to Miami for Christmas and begins drinking . He performs surgery intoxicated allowing a woman to experience an orgasm at the drop of a hat . Anyway , Christian's life is getting better with a new home , his son Wilbur , and his new fianc√© Michelle . Of course , Michelle has yet to inform him of James ' true profession . You thought prostitution was bad , unfortunately , James befriends Reefer and you can figure out the rest if you know what's going on . There are humorous scenes like Sean playing Santa Claus and depressing the children who sit on his lap . Of course , don't forget his scene with the female dwarf .

The story follows a father who is dealing with the death of his daughter and the resulting trauma.

0,"First Rate Cast but weak script hurts film ! We will never know who killed Lizzie BOrden's father and stepmother for sure . She claims to be innocent and the house where the murders occurred is now a bed and breakfast but quite haunted . Elizabeth Montgomery plays Lizzie Borden , Katherine Helmond plays her sister who has her doubts about her sister's guilt . While the Borden murders were brutal and horrible , Victorian women did not do such things . There were no witnesses to the actual murders and there is a lot of argument and discussion regarding Lizzie's involvement since she stood to inherit her father's estate along with her sister . The movie doesn't show doubt as it shows Lizzie doing the crimes . I still have more questions than answers about the BOrden murders but I don't think it was Lizzie .
","The first person is a human being, but the weakly written plot leaves us with an unexplainable mystery, leaving us with a sense of confusion and a lack of closure. The protagonist is portrayed by a certain person, and her sib plays her, both of whom have a strong sly sense of dread. The Bordens were brutal and horrific, and Victorian ladies were not supposed to do such a horrific act. There were no actual physical traces of the Bordens' deaths, and the sly sense of dread is palpable, even though the actual perpetration was never revealed. The plot is unclear and the characters are surprisingly likable. The premise is intriguing, but the lack of",71.04,7.6,816,652,137,115,google/flan-t5-xl,declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xl,54.5517680644989,0.1059,0.0999999999999999,0.629827082157135,0.0797995376638604,9,15,29,7,60.45,9.6
0,"A Wonderful Heartfelt Movie to be watched over and over again ! I read somewhere that Gwyneth Paltrow wore her fat-suit around to see people's reaction . Almost unrecognizable , she received negative , malevolent treatment from total strangers . People were not giving her the time of the day . Obesity is seen as a weakness or an embarrassment by the general population . Even though , the American population is getting more obese each day and not just by eating the wrong foods . One of the reasons I love this movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Rosemary gives her a heart and soul . You cannot help but like Rosemary . When Hal sees her under Tony Robbins spell , you begin to see a pattern . He sees other people in the same light . Their inner beauty comes alive . The most heart-wrenching scene is at the pediatric burn unit where he is comforting Cadence . It is perhaps my favorite scene in the movie . Hal becomes more human and falls in love with Rosemary even though he does not see the actual person until the end of the film . I cannot help but like this film for not trying to change Rosemary nor anybody else . It was Hal who needed to be changed . Love is blind until you see the inner beauty of your soulmate . This film is also good to watch to gain a better tolerance and understanding of obesity . You do not have to be physically beautiful to have inner beauty . Inner beauty remains long after the physical beauty has faded away .
","This is an excellent and thought-provoking documentary about the effects of weight on the human body. It follows the story of the character, who is a severely overweight woman, as she attempts to find her identity in a fat suit. The documentary follows her journey to self-discovery and ultimately reveals the power of the human body to heal and transform. Through her journey, the documentary teaches viewers about the importance of acceptance and self-worth, and how a physical appearance is not the only measure of who a human is.",75.4,5.9,1466,533,254,89,google/flan-t5-xl,declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xl,53.1839759349823,0.2655999999999999,0.3049999999999999,0.5555927753448486,0.0230458815377896,11,45,44,10,48.84,12.0
0,"Packs a punch ! I am big fan of Tennessee Williams ' A Streetcar Named Desire . Finally , I watched a video film of this yesterday and it still packs a punch . Imagine all the events take place in one day . Dame Elizabeth Taylor and Dame Judith Anderson playing southern wives and belles but they're not weak just desperate . Madeleine Sherwood deserved a Best SUpporting Actress nomination for her performance . I think she proved that she can handle the heat in the kitchen with those dames and of course , Paul Newman and Burl Ives . I felt sorry for this family who had lived the American dream . It's quite a tragedy . Brick and Maggie are trapped in a marriage which make neither one of them happy . HIs brother Goober and his wife , Mae , have provided plenty of heirs for the family fortune to a grandfather who does everything to avoid the children or Maggie puts it "" little monsters . "" I kind of felt sorry for Goober and Mae being treated like second class citizens for the favorite , Brick and Maggie . Of course , Mae isn't attractive but she breeds like a rabbit . Goober went to law school and has done everything to please his father , Big Daddy , but nothing does . Even his wife , Big Mama is trapped in a marriage . Nobody is really happy here . The casting of Larry Gates and Madeleine Sherwood is excellent and all the actors do a fantastic job especially creating SOuthern accents like Dame Judith and Dame Liz . I don't think you can remake this film to create the kind of magic and chemistry that this cast has already established . Burl Ives gives the best performance of the bunch here . It really is his movie . He created the role of Big Daddy on Broadway before bringing it to film . This is his WIlly Loman role that Lee J . Cobb made famous . I wouldn't want to see a live stage production after this of this play . This film is colorful , brilliant , tragic , and yet so human the entire time .
",I am a big admiration of certain person's literary piece and I watched a video version of certain date and it still packs a powerful impact. The setting of certain date is absolutely stunning and the portrayals of certain person and certain person are absolutely brilliant. The supporting and lead females are also superb and the nuances of certain person and certain person's relationship are incredibly well-crafted. I can't believe how powerful this piece is and how it manages to capture so much of the emotion and complexity of certain person's writing.
