0,"So Funny that you'll cry laughing ! What a combination of great talent in this cast and that includes Oscar nominees Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton with 2-time Oscar winner Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman playing their despicable boss . Remember when typewriters were the computers of our time and on every office desktop imaginable . Anyway , I liked Peggy Pope and Marian Mercer as well but you can't top Tomlin as divorced mother of four Viola , Dolly's Doralee happily married to a country singer , and Jane's Judy who is not always goody two shoes . The three women become friends and smoke a joint after their boss played brilliantly by Dabney Coleman . I think the cast just had such a grand old time making this movie that there is still talk of a reunion and the four major cast members reunited last year for Jane's charity benefit in Atlanta , Georgia . I loved the scenes where they imagined giving Hart played by Coleman , a taste of his own medicine . The kidnapping is also worth watching as well . I can't forget Sterling Hayden . This comedy is one of the all-time classic comedies especially about working environments and women's rights . When these three women take charge , they make changes that brought differences to the working place where their employees became better people which means happier employees . I guarantee if you are an employer and you want a productive environment , you have to have a happy working staff regardless of the cost .
","This hilarious and nostalgic office satirical flick features a stellar performance by the legendary Robert De Niro as a scheming corporate tycoon. The performances of the other two members of the supporting role, John Cusack and Sigourney Weaver, are also superb. The witty dialogue, along with the hilariously satirical plot, make this a must-watch for any office-goers.",59.23,10.1,1469,371,231,52,google/flan-t5-xl,declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xl,51.9469199180603,0.15499999999999997,0.08999999999999997,0.6235462427139282,0.06400964781931417,19,30,44,18,43.73,11.9
